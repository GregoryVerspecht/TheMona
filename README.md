# The Mona

**The Mona** is an interactive and expandable drinking game built with the Raspberry Pi. Whether you're at a party or just hanging out with friends, The Mona adds a unique twist to your gatherings. Featuring robust, illuminated buttons, the game offers various playful challenges that are easy to expand with new features. It's designed to be portable and customizable, so you can tweak the game options and rules to fit any occasion.

Not only is it fun to play, but it's also a blast to build and customize. I hope you enjoy creating and playing it as much as I did.

Cheers, 
Gregory!
